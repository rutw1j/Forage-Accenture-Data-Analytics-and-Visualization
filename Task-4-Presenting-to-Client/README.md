## Interview Tip
“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Accenture’s Data Analytics & Visualization job
simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand
what it might be like to participate in a typical project team at Accenture, and
to use Excel and data analytics and visualization skills in a realistic
context. 
Through this program I realized that I really enjoy cleaning, modelling and
analyzing client data, creating slides to communicate findings and presenting
insights back to the client. I would love to apply what I've learned in
a diverse project team at a company like Accenture.
